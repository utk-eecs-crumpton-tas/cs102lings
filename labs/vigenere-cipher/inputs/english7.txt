how does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower?
how do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
leave the battlefield waving betsy ross' flag higher?
yo, turns out we have a secret weapon
an immigrant, you know and love, who's unafraid to step in
he's constantly confusin', confoundin' the british henchmen
ev'ryone give it up for america's favorite fighting frenchman
lafayette!
