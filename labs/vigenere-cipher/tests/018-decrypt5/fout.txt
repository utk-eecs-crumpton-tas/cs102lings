every morning in africa, a gazelle wakes up,
it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or
it will be killed. every morning in africa,
a lion wakes up. it knows it must run faster
than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve.
it doesn't matter if you're the lion or
the gazelle-when the sun comes up, you'd
better be running.
